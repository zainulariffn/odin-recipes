    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Ayam Palekko is a processed duck meat dish that is one of the typical
      culinary dishes of South Sulawesi (Sulsel). The dish is said to originate
      from Sidrap Regency, but is popularized in Pinrang.

    <p>
      The origin of the nasu palekko food is still a matter of debate. The
      naming of the name Nasu Palekko has also given rise to two versions with
      different interpretations.
