    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The origins of Apam balik / 曼煎粿 attributes its invention to Zuo
        Zongtang, a military leader of the late Qing dynasty.<br />
        In 1855, the army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom invaded the Fujian
        region and General Zuo was appointed to lead an army to crush the
        rebels.
      </p>

      <p>
        To provide the soldiers with food without interfering the life of local
        people, General Zuo decided to switch from the <br />flatbread which was
        eaten together with spring onion and chilli sauce, to a pancake that
        used locally sourced and mass-produced ground cane sugar and peanut as
        filling.
