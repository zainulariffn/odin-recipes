    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The origin of Rendang could be traced back to the Indian merchants, who
      brought their food to Indonesia which was adapted by Minang people as
      gulai.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minang people cooked this gulai further to prepare kalio. The cooking
      process was then continued until it thickened and became rendang.
